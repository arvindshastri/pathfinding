## Description
This project implements a Graph data structure to analyze the London Subway Network (data presented through .csv files) and uses Graph Traversal 
Algorithms such as Dijkstra and A* to compute the shortest path between two nodes. Also incorporated are benchmarks between algorithms and test cases.

## Usage
Usage, analysis and explanations are detailed in the Jupyter Notebook file.
