WHEN WE READ THE LINES OF THE CSV, STORE THE LINE IN A TEMP VAR 
SO THAT IT IS MORE CONVENIENT TO CALL.


STATION READER PSEUDO
have class definition of station up here?

for line+1 in stations.csv:
    create a station object with parameters along the row
    append to a "stations" list 
return the list as function output


LINE READER PSEUDO
have class def
for line+1 in lines.csv:
    create line object with parameters fed in
    append object to "lines" DICTIONARY
return DICTIONARY as function output


#dict because we can key into the dict at a constant time, 
rather than traversing the list to find the relevant line.


CONNECTION READER PSEUDO(line list)
have class definitions of CONNECTION (has S1, S2, CI), 
CONNECTION INFO (line, time, other metrics if necessary)
for line+1 in connection.csv:
    line OBJECT (put key into dict to obtain relevant line)
    , time will be fed into connection info object creation.
    connection object creation will be fed s1(OBJECTS), s2, above CI object.
    append object to "connections" list
return list as function output.


GRAPH GENERATION PSEUDO (station list, connection list)
#use adjacency list, google an implementation using dictionaries.







USE DICTONARY, SINCE STATION 1 CAN JUST BE S1 KEY.
