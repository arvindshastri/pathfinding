connections: Represent the edges. 
Station 1 means the starting node, Station 2 means the ending node.
Line means the line that a rider would take to get from Station 1 to Station 2
Time means the time that it takes to get from Station 1 to Station 2, using this specific line.
    We are thinking of using time to Represent the "distance" of the path. 


lines: Additional information regarding edges
Line, Name, Colour are all unique identifiers for the edges.
Stripe, we are unsure what it represents at the moment.

stations: The nodes in our graph
Id, Name is a unique identifier for the station
latitude, longitude tell us where the station is placed on a map.
Display Name is NULL when the name does not contain a space
Zone, Total lines, rail are unknown at the moment.


JUSTIFICATION FOR GB:
make interface for graph builder class. have pre defined empty functions
that will be inherited for every new GB for every new CSV file format.
swap at runtime, graph generation and ME should remain same.
good for anticipating (unknown) change. **FACTORY PATTERN / STRATEGY PATTERN**

factory for swapping GB. strategy for swapping shortest path algorithm.
