    "-line, station, and connection have been chosen to have their own classes because this design follows the single responsibility principle. A single file does not have to worry about information of both lines and station, and instead has the sole purpose of depicting the properties of one individual thing.\n",
    "-connection info is its own class because that allows us to compact the connection class and treat the connection more as a traditional edge that contains two connecting nodes. Adding more information to an edge does not modify the connection class, which ties into single responsibility, open-closed principle?\n",
